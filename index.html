<h1>Visual Studios & Console</h1>

<p>To access Visual Studios you will first need to create a file on the desktop. Then, you will have to log in to Visual Studios. After that, you have to click on "file" on the top left corner and then click on "open folder". After that, click on the new folder you just created on the desktop and it will bring you to a new page. After that click on "file" again and click on "new folder". You will then need to click on "file" once more and click on "save as" and in the place of "untitled-1", type in "index.html". Finally, you would need to repeat the process you did for html to "main.js" and "style.css" and then you could start working on the platform.</p>
<p>Console is a place where you can check your code to see if it is working properly.The reason we use this is because, if there is a problem with your code and you don't know where it is, you can check in console and it will tell you wich line there is an error on. To see where the console is you will have to right click the page and click on the option "inspect". After that, you need to click on the "console" option which is right next to the "elements" option you start off with. Once you do that, you can see everything you decided to double check to see if the inputs are the same. In order to print something in console you need to type in "console.log()", and in those brackets you can type a number, a string, a variable, or you can type in an equation by writing Math.(Num1 any operation Num2) inside the brackets.
